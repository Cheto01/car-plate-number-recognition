# car-plate-number-recognition
This project is used as a showcase of how YOLO Model can be used to detect objects

## Data and Models Used in This Tutorial
Video: You can use any video of vehicles with the US plate number

## Vehicle Detection
We employed a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to identify vehicles within the video footage. 
The training and data preparation process was inspired by this step-by-step tutorial[https://github.com/computervisioneng/train-yolov8-custom-dataset-step-by-step-guide].
The plate recognition model is not available here.

## Dependencies: 
This code requires a sort module that needs to be downloaded separately from the following repository: [https://github.com/abewley/sort].
